Hacking around a proof-of-concept, and now refactoring into a reusable module. 

reSTX is an offline tool for publishing flat websites. It recursively parses 
restructured text files in a directory tree, creating html in each directory. 
Sites may therefore be written and updated using reST, which is a fast and less 
distracting way to author content.
