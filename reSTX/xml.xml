    <paragraph>Next steps, are to look at the parsing of a file like this, or a directory of
files. Not with the command-line tools in the <literal>docutils</literal> package, but with our
own parser. It would then construct a flat site, with everything bound together
with our own navigation. Surely using django templates? But maybe not, maybe
using <literal>xslt</literal>.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Here's a paragraph. In the document I make sure to keep it's line length below
80 characters, as that'll be our standard.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A list of stuff:</paragraph>

        <paragraph>A simple way to show off the RsT formatting</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Here's an example of some <literal>html</literal> code:</paragraph>
    <literal_block xml:space="preserve">&lt;html&gt;
  &lt;head&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;The title&lt;/title&gt;
  &lt;/head&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;</literal_block>
    <paragraph>And maybe some <literal>javascript</literal> code too, indented with just two spaces:</paragraph>
    <literal_block xml:space="preserve">function doSomething (x, y) {
  return x*y;
}</literal_block>
    <paragraph>Okay, that'e enough now! Oh no, hang on, how about a <reference name="link to something" refuri="http://www.bbc.co.uk/">link to something</reference>.
There! Now we're done!</paragraph>
